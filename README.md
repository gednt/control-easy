# ControlEasy Reborn

ControlEasy Reborn is a multi-tenant condominium access-control web platform for managing residents, visitors, vehicles, service providers, apartments, photos, consent policies, and gatehouse ("portaria") operations.

## Overview

Built as a high-performance modular monolith with an Angular 18 SPA frontend and an ASP.NET Core 8 minimal API backend, ControlEasy Reborn enforces strict tenant isolation, role- and permission-based authorization, and Docker-driven local and production workflows.

### Technology Stack

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 8 (C# 12 minimal API endpoints, Clean Architecture per module)
- **Frontend:** Angular 18 SPA (standalone components, signals, OnPush change detection, Lucide icons)
- **Data Access:** [DBTools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DBTools) 1.4.3 (`Linq<T>`, `IAsyncSqlClient`) — Custom open-source ORM created by Felipe Coelho (in development since 2014) — No EF Core
- **Database:** MySQL 8
- **Reverse Proxy & Gateway:** Traefik v3.1
- **Logging & Diagnostics:** Serilog (Console JSON + Seq)
- **Client Generation:** OpenAPI 3 schema via Swashbuckle → Angular services via `ng-openapi-gen`
- **Testing:** xUnit, FluentAssertions, NSubstitute, Testcontainers.MySql, NetArchTest.Rules, Playwright, Karma/Jasmine

## Origin & Evolution

**ControlEasy Reborn** is the modern evolution of the original **ControlEasy** project, which originated as a final course completion project (*Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso — TCC*) at **ETEC** (Escola Técnica Estadual), developed as a graduation requirement to obtain the technical degree.

Following the conclusion of the course, custody and ownership of the code remained with **Felipe Coelho**, who continued its development and architectural transformation across three software generations:

1. **First Generation (VB.NET & Windows Forms):** Developed originally as a desktop application in Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) with Windows Forms, handling basic gatehouse logging and local desktop-based condominium administration.
2. **Second Generation (C# Windows Forms):** Ported to C# to improve type safety, maintainability, and code structure, continuing desktop-based operations.
3. **Third Generation — ControlEasy Reborn (Modern Web & Multi-Tenancy):** Complete architectural rebirth into a high-performance web platform — engineered as a Clean Architecture modular monolith on ASP.NET Core 8 minimal APIs, an Angular 18 SPA with reactive signals, and native multi-tenancy supporting multiple condominium complexes on a shared, isolated infrastructure.

### The Story of DBTools (Custom ORM)

A defining architectural characteristic across ControlEasy's history is the intentional use of **[DBTools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DBTools)** instead of standard heavyweight ORMs like Entity Framework Core. 

DBTools was created by **Felipe Coelho** in **2014** during the initial development of ControlEasy. It was conceived to provide fast, predictable, LINQ-to-SQL query composition tailored specifically to access-control workflows without the hidden magic, complex change-tracking, and runtime overhead of general-purpose ORMs. Over more than a decade of active use and refinement, DBTools evolved naturally alongside ControlEasy from internal data-access utilities into the standalone, open-source NuGet package utilized across the solution today. In ControlEasy Reborn, DBTools underpins tenant-isolated query generation through `ITenantAwareLinqFactory` while sustaining high-throughput gatehouse operations.

### AI-Augmented Engineering (Not "Vibe Coding")

It is important to emphasize: **ControlEasy Reborn was not "vibe coded" — it was rigorously AI-augmented.**

Rather than unconstrained, prompt-and-pray code generation, the modernization from legacy desktop codebases into a modular monolith was executed through disciplined, human-architected software engineering amplified by AI. Every component conforms to strict architectural invariants, verified specifications, and automated quality gates:

- **Specification-First, Not Prompt-Driven:** No feature or refactoring is built without upfront requirements elicitation, design specifications, and dependency-ordered tasks (`.specs/`, `openspec/`).
- **Constitutional Architectural Invariants:** Strict architectural boundaries and Clean Architecture rules are codified in a binding project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) and automatically validated on every build via `NetArchTest.Rules`.
- **Exhaustive Automated Verification:** Every task must pass comprehensive automated test suites (xUnit unit tests, Testcontainers MySQL integration tests, Playwright E2E suites, and Axe Core accessibility checks) before completion.
- **Adversarial Multi-Agent Review:** Proposed changes are systematically stress-tested by parallel adversarial review personas (Blind Hunter, Edge-Case Hunter, Acceptance Auditor) prior to human review and commit.
- **Complete Human Architectural Direction:** System design, domain modeling, security policies, and final merge decisions remain strictly directed and approved by the author.
- **Uncompromising Standards (and Authorial Stubbornness):** It is worth stating candidly that the author is notoriously meticulous — at times to the point of being downright annoying — whenever any part of the codebase is not strictly to his liking. This perfectionism can be readily evidenced throughout the repository: zero-tolerance compiler warnings (`<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>`), automated NetArchTest architectural boundaries, rigid Docker-only and Git worktree isolation rules, and relentless refactoring passes across every module.

The agent frameworks facilitating this AI-augmented development include:

- **[GSD-core](.planning/) (Get Stuff Done):** Orchestrates the macro-level migration roadmap across 14 systematic development phases, tracking live project state, decision logs, codebase maps, and milestone verifications.
- **[spec-kit](.specify/) (Specification-Driven Development):** Enforces a specification-first engineering methodology anchored by the project constitution. Every non-trivial feature or refactoring undergoes rigorous requirement clarification, architecture planning (`spec.md`, `plan.md`), and ordered task execution (`tasks.md`).
- **[OpenSpec](openspec/) (Change & Delta Specifications):** Manages structured change proposals, designs, and delta-specification tracking, allowing targeted feature development and regression prevention.
- **[BMAD Method](_bmad/) & WDS (Multi-Agent Role Collaboration):** Deploys collaborative agent personas (System Architect Winston, Senior Developer Amelia, Test Architect Murat, Business Analyst Mary, and UX Designers) for adversarial code reviews, edge-case hunting, and automated quality audits.
- **[agents-template](AGENTS.md) & [Impeccable](.impeccable/):** Defines the binding runtime contract and governance invariants for all AI coding assistants (strict Docker-only development, Git worktree isolation, pre-commit adversarial review gates) alongside design system and frontend excellence standards.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Engine 24+** with **Docker Compose v2** (`docker compose`)
- **Git**
- Available host ports: `8080` (HTTP), `8443` (HTTPS), `8082` (Traefik dashboard)

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gednt/ControlEasy.git
   cd ControlEasy
   ```

2. **Configure environment (optional for local development):**
   ```bash
   cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
   ```

3. **Start the complete stack:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
   ```
   Or using the Makefile shortcut:
   ```bash
   make up
   ```

4. **Retrieve first-boot credentials & sign in:**
   Inspect the API container logs to obtain the generated PlatformAdmin credentials:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs api | grep "CHANGE IMMEDIATELY"
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to sign in and set your new password.

## Demo Mode

To evaluate ControlEasy Reborn with pre-populated sample data (two themed condominiums, residents, visitors, attendant profiles, and fixed credentials `demo123`):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.demo.yml up -d --build
```

Access personas and sample scenarios:
- **Portaria / Attendant:** `porteiro@controleasy.app` / `demo123`
- **Tenant Administrator:** `admin@aurora.controleasy.app` / `demo123`
- **Platform Administrator:** `platform@controleasy.app` / `demo123`

> **Security Warning:** Never use the demo signing key or demo overlay in production environments.
