# AGENTS.md — ControlEasy Reborn

> **Authoritative project guide.** Binding runtime document for every
> contributor and every agent. Constitutional authority:
> `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v1.6.0, 2026-09-17).
> Where this file and the constitution disagree, the constitution wins.

---

## Reader contract (minimal)

An agent reading `AGENTS.md` alone (without `AGENTS-SPEC.md`) MUST:

1. Treat sections without an `<!-- owner:... -->` comment as **project-owned**: their content is binding for this repository and the agent obeys it.
2. Treat sections marked `<!-- owner:<workflow> -->` as **workflow-owned**: the agent obeys the *non-empty* blocks for workflows it knows it is running. Empty blocks (between `<!-- owner:<workflow> -->` and `<!-- /owner -->` with no content) are inert.
3. Honor a freshness stamp (`<!-- verified YYYY-MM-DD against <sha> -->` or `<!-- approved YYYY-MM-DD -->`) on workflow blocks as a cache-invalidation signal. Orientation sections do not carry stamps.
4. Treat the `## Skill overlays` list as a set of pointers to sibling files. The agent reads those sibling files directly; it does not assume any overlay owns anything in `AGENTS.md`.
5. Treat the schema header (`<!-- agents-template-schema 1 -->`) as the version this file conforms to. Unknown section names do not error; the agent ignores them.

## Project

ControlEasy Reborn is a condominium access-control web platform for managing residents, visitors, vehicles, service providers, apartments, and gatehouse ("portaria") operations. Built for condominium administrators, portaria staff, and residents.

**Target architecture:** ASP.NET Core 8 modular monolith + Angular 18 SPA + MySQL 8 + Docker Compose + JWT bearer. Nine feature modules (Residents, Visits, Vehicles, ServiceProviders, Apartments, Security, Tenants, Reports, Administration), each with Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Api).

---

## Repo anatomy

Orientation for the top-level layout so an agent can find things without guesswork.

- `src/` — ASP.NET Core 8 solution, Angular 18 SPA, shared building blocks, and nine feature modules. Tracked source.
  - `src/Host/ControlEasyReborn.Api/` — API host (minimal API endpoints, DI registration).
  - `src/Web/ControlEasyReborn.Web/` — Angular 18 SPA (standalone components, signals).
  - `src/BuildingBlocks/` — shared cross-cutting code (auth, error handling, middleware).
  - `src/Modules/<Feature>/{Domain,Application,Infrastructure,Api}/` — nine feature modules.
  - `src/Directory.Build.props`, `src/Directory.Packages.props` — central build properties and package versioning.
  - `src/ControlEasyReborn.sln` — the solution file.
- `tests/` — xUnit test projects. Tracked source.
  - `tests/ControlEasyReborn.UnitTests/` — unit tests.
  - `tests/ControlEasyReborn.IntegrationTests/` — integration tests (Testcontainers.MySql).
  - `tests/ControlEasyReborn.ArchitectureTests/` — NetArchTest architecture rules.
  - `tests/a11y/`, `tests/visual/` — accessibility and visual regression tests.
- `docker/` — Docker Compose files, Dockerfiles, MySQL init scripts. Tracked source.
  - `docker/docker-compose.yml` — main stack (api, web, db, reverse-proxy, adminer, seq).
  - `docker/docker-compose.demo.yml` — demo overlay (pre-populated data, fixed credentials; never in production).
  - `docker/docker-compose.worktree.template.yml` — per-worktree override template.
- `.planning/` — GSD-core workflow directory. Roadmap, state, phases, milestones. Workflow-owned.
- `.specs/` — spec-kit per-feature specifications (requirements / design / tasks). Workflow-owned (spec-kit).
- `.specify/` — spec-kit configuration and memory (constitution). Workflow-owned (spec-kit).
- `openspec/` — OpenSpec change-tracking (opt-in). Workflow-owned.
- `_bmad/` — BMAD workflow configuration and skills. Workflow-owned.
- `_bmad-output/` — BMAD planning artifacts. Workflow-owned.
- `agents-init/` — agents-template onboarding skill (canonical SKILL.md). Overlay-owned.
- `docs/` — operator and developer documentation. Tracked source.
- `scripts/` — worktree management and utility scripts. Tracked source.
- `mockup/` — UI mockup reference files. Tracked source.
- `Makefile` — convenience targets (up, down, test, build, restore, clean).
- `global.json` — .NET SDK version pinning.
- `AGENTS-TEMPLATE.md`, `AGENTS-SPEC.md` — agents-template schema artifacts (read before editing this file).

Rules of thumb:

- Generated output (`bin/`, `obj/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`) is gitignored; do not document it.
- Configuration files at the repo root are project-owned; do not put policy or conventions in them.

## Build, test, and development commands

Canonical commands an agent should run. The project uses Docker Compose for the full stack and .NET / npm for individual layers.

### Build

- `dotnet build src/ControlEasyReborn.sln` — build the entire .NET solution.
- `cd src/Web/ControlEasyReborn.Web && npm run build` — build the Angular SPA (runs `ng-openapi-gen` first via `prebuild`).
- `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build` — build all container images.

### Test

- `dotnet test tests/ControlEasyReborn.UnitTests` — unit tests (xUnit + FluentAssertions + NSubstitute).
- `dotnet test tests/ControlEasyReborn.IntegrationTests` — integration tests (Testcontainers.MySql).
- `dotnet test tests/ControlEasyReborn.ArchitectureTests` — architecture rules (NetArchTest.Rules).
- `cd src/Web/ControlEasyReborn.Web && npm test -- --no-watch --browsers=ChromeHeadless` — Angular unit tests (Karma + Jasmine).
- `cd src/Web/ControlEasyReborn.Web && npm run e2e` — Playwright E2E tests. Set `E2E_BASE_URL=https://ce-<branch>.localhost:<port>`.

### Lint / format

- `cd src/Web/ControlEasyReborn.Web && npm run lint` — ESLint (`@angular-eslint/recommended`).
- `cd src/Web/ControlEasyReborn.Web && npm run format` — Prettier (single quotes, 120 cols).
- `cd src/Web/ControlEasyReborn.Web && npm run openapi-check` — verify OpenAPI-generated types are up to date.

### Local development

The canonical dev shell is the **devcontainer** under `.devcontainer/`. The
host shell (PowerShell 7+ on Windows, `bash`/`zsh` on macOS/Linux) is an
acceptable fallback for trivial read-only inspection (`git status`, `ls`,
`cat`) but MUST NOT be used for build / test / lint / restore / install. See
Constitution Principle V ("Dev shell") for the binding procedure and
Principle VIII ("Host-OS / Shell-Aware Command Execution") for the
platform/shell rules that govern every command in this section.

**Canonical bring-up procedure (per worktree, per session):**

1. **Open the worktree in a devcontainer-aware IDE** (VS Code, Cursor,
   JetBrains, GitHub Codespaces). The IDE MUST attach to the devcontainer
   defined by `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. An
   `AUTO_START_COMPOSE=true` env var auto-runs the bring-up; otherwise
   step 2 is manual.
2. **Bring up the Compose stack** (canonical first boot of a worktree).
   Inside the devcontainer shell:
   ```bash
   docker compose -p ce-<branch-hyphens> \
     -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
     -f docker/docker-compose.worktree.<branch-hyphens>.yml \
     up -d --build
   ```
   The `-p` (project) flag scopes container names, networks, and the MySQL
   volume to this worktree; the worktree override (built from
   `docker/docker-compose.worktree.template.yml`) pins the unique
   hostname, host port, and DB volume declared in the "Worktree naming
   convention" table below.
3. **Wait for health.** All services MUST reach `health: healthy` before
   any verification step. `docker compose -p ce-<branch> ps` reports the
   per-service state; the `api` service's `/health` endpoint is the
   canonical readiness probe.
4. **Run the verification gate** (inside the devcontainer):
   ```bash
   docker compose -p ce-<branch> exec -T api \
     dotnet test /workspace/tests/ControlEasyReborn.UnitTests
   # repeat for IntegrationTests and ArchitectureTests; then
   docker compose -p ce-<branch> exec -T web \
     npm test -- --no-watch --browsers=ChromeHeadless
   ```
5. **Tear down** (when the worktree is merged or abandoned):
   `docker compose -p ce-<branch> down -v` removes only that worktree's
   containers, networks, and volume. Other worktrees are untouched.
6. **Override paths.** The demo overlay (`docker-compose.demo.yml`)
   replaces the worktree override in step 2 when demo data is wanted;
   the `scripts/verify-devcontainer.sh` script replaces steps 2–5 for an
   unattended end-to-end gate.

**One-shot bring-up commands** (use the devcontainer for any non-trivial
session; these are the canonical one-liners when the devcontainer is not
available):

- `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build` — full stack
  (canonical first boot, no worktree scoping).
- `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.demo.yml up -d --build`
  — demo mode overlay (pre-populated data; never use in production).
- `cd src/Web/ControlEasyReborn.Web && npm start` — Angular dev server
  only (API must already be running).
- `make up` / `make down` / `make test` / `make build` — Makefile
  convenience targets (wrap the commands above).

Containers: the compose file is `docker/docker-compose.yml`. The
project-name convention is `ce-<branch-hyphens>` (e.g.,
`ce-feat-dashboard-live-stats`). Worktree compose overrides use
`docker/docker-compose.worktree.template.yml`. See `docs/dev-setup.md` for
the full devcontainer + worktree guide.

## Policy

Hard rules an agent must not violate, beyond what the workflows enforce.

- **Mandatory Local CI Verification Gate.** The verification suite has two distinct tiers:
  1. **Per-Turn Fast Gate (`scripts/verify-ci-local.sh --fast`):** Enforced automatically on agent stop after conversational turns where code files are modified. Runs format check (`dotnet format --verify-no-changes`), Release build, and unit/architecture tests in ~3 seconds with ZERO Docker downloads and ZERO containers.
  2. **Task Completion / End of All Tasks Full Gate (`scripts/verify-ci-local.sh`):** Runs the full 6-stage suite: format, build, unit & architecture tests, Testcontainers MySQL integration tests, Angular Docker production build, and OpenAPI client drift check. The CI tasks that need to download things inside Docker (Testcontainers MySQL and Docker web build) run **only once per task completion, at the end of all tasks completions, not after every turn**. Claiming completion, checking off tasks, or pushing code without running and passing the full local CI suite on the final state is a strict constitutional violation. Automated agent Stop hooks in `.agents/hooks.json`, `.agent/hooks.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.cursor/hooks.json`, and `.opencode/plugins/verify-ci.ts` enforce the fast gate per turn and the full gate on committed task completion.
- **Platform-aware command execution (Constitution Principle VIII).** Agents MUST detect the host OS and shell before issuing any terminal command and MUST NOT run platform-mismatched syntax. POSIX-only snippets (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`, `set -euo pipefail`, `[[ ... ]]`, `$(...)` chains inside single-quoted heredocs, `tr`/`awk`/`sed -i ''`, GNU-only flags) MUST NOT be invoked from a Windows host shell — the canonical fix is to run them inside the devcontainer, to use the cross-platform PowerShell wrappers (`scripts/worktree-up.ps1` / `scripts/worktree-down.ps1`), or to translate the snippet and call out the translation in the reply. PowerShell-only constructs (`Get-ChildItem`, `Remove-Item -LiteralPath`, `New-Item -ItemType Directory`, `Test-Path -LiteralPath`, backtick escaping) MUST NOT be issued from a POSIX host. When a command fails because of a platform mismatch, the agent MUST stop, identify the mismatch, and either retry through the correct shell or escalate to the user — it MUST NOT chain a second platform-specific command after the first fails. Skill and doc examples prefer platform-neutral composition (`docker compose …`), which is valid on every host because Compose runs inside the container engine, not the host shell.
- **No EF Core.** DBTools (`Linq<TModel>`, `IAsyncSqlClient`) is the only data-access library. LINQ-first; raw SQL only for stored procs (ADR 0002).
- **No MediatR.** Handlers are registered as scoped services directly.
- **No MVC controllers.** Minimal API endpoint classes only.
- **All tenant-scoped reads/writes via `ITenantAwareLinqFactory`.** No cross-tenant data access.
- **Secrets never in `App.config`.** Use environment variables or Docker secrets.
- **BCrypt cost >= 11** for password hashing.
- **`ProblemDetails` (RFC 7807)** for all error responses. Domain exceptions: `NotFoundException`, `ValidationException`, `ConflictException`.
- **Serilog** structured logging to Console (JSON) + Seq.
- **spec-kit** is the per-feature specification system. Specs live in `.specs/<feature>/`. Configuration and constitutional memory in `.specify/`. spec-kit owns `.specs/` and `.specify/` and updates `STATE.md` + `PROJECT.md` when state changes.
- **Four workflow systems, non-overlapping responsibility:** GSD owns `.planning/`, spec-kit owns `.specs/` and `.specify/`, OpenSpec is opt-in at user discretion (only the user creates `openspec/changes/<id>/`), and BMAD is the review/analysis/adversarial-quality layer (see Constitution Principle IX; BMAD owns `_bmad/` and `_bmad-output/`).

### Git worktree rule (mandatory)

- **The main tree stays pristine.** The main checkout (`<repo-root>` on its default branch) is read-only for agents until work is committed: no file edits, no generated artifacts, no build/test outputs, no formatting, no `.gitignore` churn, and no commits. Before starting any work, an agent MUST first create a worktree (see below) and do all reading, editing, building, and testing inside it. Read-only commands (`git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, grep/search) are the only operations permitted on the main checkout.
- **All Git work happens in a worktree.** When an agent (AI or human) is making a change, never commit, branch, push, or merge on `main`. The only permitted operation on `main` is fast-forwarding `main` to a feature branch's tip after a human has reviewed and approved the change. Create a dedicated Git worktree under `<repo-root>/.worktrees/` on a branch `feat/<slug>` or `fix/<slug>`, where `<slug>` is a semantic, lowercase, hyphen-separated name describing the change.
- **Worktrees live inside the repo, under `.worktrees/`. Ensure `.worktrees/` is listed in `.gitignore` so worktree contents are never tracked. The canonical path is `<repo-root>/.worktrees/<branch-with-slashes-as-hyphens>` (e.g., `.worktrees/feat-dashboard-live-stats`).
- **The agent reports done; the human merges on `main`.** The agent commits, branches, and pushes inside the worktree, then stops. The agent MUST NOT run `git merge` on `main` for any reason, unless the human explicitly says, in the current turn, "merge on main.". If the human says it to merge on main, remove the worktree and its directory after the merge.
- **Pre-flight check before creating a worktree.** Use only read-only Git commands to confirm that the branch does not already exist and that the worktree path is not already in use. If either exists, abort and pick a different slug.
- **One task, one worktree, one branch.** Do not reuse a slug, a branch, or a worktree path between concurrent tasks.
- **Canonical command.** `git worktree add ".worktrees/$(echo $BRANCH | tr / -)" -b "$BRANCH"` (run from the repo root) is the canonical way to create the worktree.
- **Clean up after merge.** After a change merges to `main` and is verified, remove only the worktree you created: `git worktree remove .worktrees/<branch-with-slashes-as-hyphens>`. Do not touch unrelated worktrees, branches, or paths.
- **No force-push, no rewriting shared history.** Do not rewrite commits that have been pushed or that other worktrees share. Local-only history rewrites (interactive rebase before push) are allowed when no one else depends on the branch.

#### Worktree naming convention

| Item | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Branch | `feat/<spec-id>-<slug>` or `fix/<spec-id>-<slug>` | `feat/dashboard-live-stats` |
| Worktree path | `.worktrees/<branch-with-slashes-as-hyphens>` | `.worktrees/feat-dashboard-live-stats` |
| Compose project | `ce-<branch-hyphens>` | `ce-feat-dashboard-live-stats` |
| Traefik host | `ce-<branch>.localhost` | `ce-feat-dashboard-live-stats.localhost` |
| Host port | `18080 + (worktree-index x 10)` | `18090` |
| DB volume | `ce-<branch>-mysql-data` | `ce-feat-dashboard-live-stats-mysql-data` |

Scripts: `scripts/worktree-up.ps1` / `.sh` (create), `scripts/worktree-down.ps1` / `.sh` (tear down).

## Workflow blocks

Each block below is owned by one workflow. The block is **inert** when empty — an agent that does not run that workflow ignores it. Workflows may replace the contents of their own block on refresh. Workflows MUST NOT modify another workflow's block.

### BMAD

<!-- owner:bmad -->
<!-- BMAD's project-context skill writes its durable context here. Delete this block if the project does not use BMAD. -->
<!-- /owner -->

### GSD-core

<!-- owner:gsd -->
<!-- GSD's onboarding skill writes its state slice here. Delete this block if the project does not use GSD-core. -->
<!-- /owner -->

### openspec

<!-- owner:openspec -->
<!-- openspec's onboarding writes its change-proposal pointer here. Delete this block if the project does not use openspec. -->
<!-- /owner -->

### Other workflows

Add a new `<!-- owner:<workflow> -->` block here when adopting a new workflow. Document the block in `AGENTS-SPEC.md` (see Extension protocol).

---

## Skill overlays

Skill overlays do not own any block in `AGENTS.md`. They are **sibling files** that the agent reads directly when needed.

- **agents-template** — `AGENTS-TEMPLATE.md` (canonical template), `AGENTS-SPEC.md` (reader contract spec), `agents-init/SKILL.md` (onboarding skill). Read template + spec before editing this file; run `agents-init` to scaffold or refresh `AGENTS.md`.

If a project stops using an overlay, remove its line. Do not leave stale pointers.

---

## Language conventions

### C#

- File-scoped namespaces.
- `sealed` classes by default.
- `PascalCase` types and methods; `_camelCase` private fields; `ALL_CAPS` constants.
- Nullable enabled (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`).
- Warnings as errors (`<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>`).
- Central package versioning (`Directory.Packages.props`).
- REST routes: kebab-case, plural nouns (`/api/v1/residents`).
- Module layout: `Modules/<Feature>/{Domain,Application,Infrastructure,Api}/`.

### Angular / TypeScript

- Standalone components (`standalone: true`).
- `OnPush` change detection.
- Signals API for reactive state.
- `ce-` component prefix; kebab-case selectors.
- ESLint `@angular-eslint/recommended`; Prettier single quotes + 120 cols.
- TypeScript strict mode.
- DTOs generated from OpenAPI via `ng-openapi-gen`; no shared domain models between frontend and backend.

---

## Conventions that differ from defaults

- **Stack:** ASP.NET Core 8 (C# 12, minimal API endpoints) + Angular 18 SPA + MySQL 8 + Docker Compose + JWT bearer.
- **Data access:** DBTools 1.4.3 (`Linq<TModel>`, `IAsyncSqlClient`). No EF Core (ADR 0002). LINQ-first; raw SQL only for stored procs.
- **Mapping:** Mapster.
- **Validation:** FluentValidation.
- **Testing:** xUnit + FluentAssertions + NSubstitute + Testcontainers.MySql + Playwright. Karma + Jasmine for Angular unit tests.
- **Runtime:** Docker Compose services: `api`, `web`, `db`, `reverse-proxy`, `adminer`, `seq`. Multi-stage Dockerfiles. Compose v2.
- **Error handling:** `ProblemDetails` (RFC 7807); Serilog to Console (JSON) + Seq. Domain exceptions: `NotFoundException`, `ValidationException`, `ConflictException`.
- **Auto-tool selection:** Agents read the user's intent and automatically invoke the right tool (spec-kit for implementation, BMAD for review/analysis, GSD for phase planning, OpenSpec for structured delta-specs at user opt-in). See `docs/agent-flow-cheatsheet.md` for lifecycle diagrams.
- **Concurrency budget:** Max 3 sub-agents in flight per level (1 main + 3 subs). Exceeding requires explicit rationale in the wave's `proposal.md`, `design.md`, or `tasks.md`.
- **Post-task verification (Mandatory Local CI Gate):** After every implementation task or code modification, the agent MUST verify its work. Per-turn stop hooks enforce fast checks (`--fast`: format, build, unit + arch tests in ~3s, zero Docker downloads). CI tasks that download things inside Docker (Testcontainers MySQL and Docker web build) run **only once per task completion, at the end of all tasks completions, not after every turn**. The full suite (`scripts/verify-ci-local.sh` or `make verify-ci`) must pass before committing, pushing, or reporting the final task complete.
- **Pre-commit adversarial review:** No agent may `git commit` until (1) build + tests are green (including the full local CI gate) and (2) an adversarial review subagent returns zero CRITICAL/HIGH findings. See existing AGENTS.md archive for full gate procedure.
